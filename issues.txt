UNRESOLVED
  - Stars do not show on background. Skip for now. Not an MVP.
  - Bullets do not show on canvas either. Both stars and bullets are defined, 
    is not skipped for any loop, bullets affect the position of the ship. 
    They are definitely somewhere on the DOM, just not visible.
  - Need to find a way to move all of the invader ships at the same time. 
    - Maybe set a local var for vel in 'game.js' or 'ship.js' and set the vel for all
    invader ships to the local vel
    - Or place the images inside a container and move the container
